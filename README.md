# FOOD-delivery-final
This is my final project for Web Services and Distributed Computing in which we learned how to make a project consisiting of microservices which can talk with eachother.
-  Note: this is only a back end project so to test the endpoints, you would need to download PostMan: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
-  Also need docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

-    Build process
      -  Open the folder location in git bash or your machines terminal
      - First step docker-compose build
      - Second Step: docker-compose up (once done you can test the endpoints in posotman)
      - Third step: Control C to stop docker-compose up
      - Fourth Step: docker-compose down to terminate docker containers
